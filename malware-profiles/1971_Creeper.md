### Description

The `Creeper` was the first worm to be recorded in the ARPANET. Therefore it only spread to a few computers.

The worm did not damage any files as it just displayed a message on the screen:

> "I'M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!" [^1] [^3]

The impact of the `Creeper` worm can mainly be described as "user annoyance". But it cannot be evaluated how much of an actual damage the software may have caused. [^3]

The `Reaper` software by Ray Tomlinson was then used to delete all copies of the `Creeper` from the system. That way, `Reaper` is reffered to as the first antivirus software. [^1] [^3]
