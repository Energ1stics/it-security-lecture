### Description

CIH was created by a computer science student in Taiwan in 1998 as a challenge to antivirus creaters. It attaches itself to executables under Windows 9x Operating systems. To avoid detection it splits its code and inserts it into free spaces in the infected file, therefore not increasing it's filesize. Other than infecting new files the virus does nothing on 364 days of the year.[^1]

The Virus carries two payload which both activate if an infected file is executed on the 26th of April of a year. This activation date earned the virus its nickname "Chernobyl Virus" as it activation date falls on the day of anniversary of the Soviet Union nuclear desaster in 1986. 
CIH's first payload overwrites the first megabyte of the computer harddrive with 0s, therefore deleting the bootsector, master boot record, partition table and file allocation table. As this information is vital to the computers boot process, the operating system won't boot up after this. In addition as the partition table and file allocation table are destroyed the machine might crash with a bluescreen of death and no file will be accessible, as the information on its location on disk is lost.
CIH's second payload tries to destroy the systems BIOS by replacing part of its routine with junk. This only succeeds if the system has a motherboard with the Intel 430TX chipset installed. If this payload succeeds, the computer won't be able to boot up again until the BIOS chip on the mainboard is replaced.[^1]
