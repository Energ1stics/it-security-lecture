# Exercise 5.1 (:handshake:/:pencil:/:house:)

1. Split into working groups of 4 students
2. Each group is assigned one of the topics (by consensus or
   randomization) described on the following slides
3. Every group prepares a digital presentation of 15-20min on their
   topic
4. At least _2 days before_ the presentation a PDF export of the
   slides is uploaded on Moodle (once per group)
5. All groups present their topic to all their classmates who can ask
   questions afterwards

# Presentation Format

* ~20-30 minutes presentation
  * _every_ group member _has to_ present for at least 5min
* ~5 minutes Q&A

_:information_source: The presentation can be written and held in :uk:
or :de: based on each group's own preference. Just do not mix English
and German slides. English slides but presentation held in German is
fine._
